# Version Control with Git: Github
### Version 1.0

**Course Summary** 
Publications that make the used code available have generally higher impact than publications where code is not available. One important tool for code quality and code sharing is a version control system (VCS). A version control system is a tool that manages changes made to the files and directories in a project. Git, together with GitHub, is one such VCS tool.

**Learning Objective**  
Learners will be able to use Github to create, manage and collaborate on projects.

**Intended Audience**  
The target audience for this training is someone who analyses data by writing code (e.g. in R or Python), at intermediate to advanced level, but is new to version control systems.

**Learning Objective Detail**  
At the end of this course participants will be able to:
* Use Git in their workflow
* Use a selection of important Git functions to manage their workflow
* Make adjustments to repositories with version control
* Unify different versions of the same document

**Course Type**  
* E learning - Not Available
* Self learning - Not Available
* Face to face - Available

**Skill Level**  
Intermediate / Advanced

**Pre requisite summary**  
Have a good grasp of files and directories and be generally knowledgeable about where things live on your computer. We will work on the command line or shell, so you should know how to open up a shell. Desirable is also that you know how to navigate to a certain directory and list the files there.

**Description**  

Sharing code is as important as sharing data for transparency and reproducibility. 

Many analysts and researchers self-learn coding and are not trained in software-engineering standards about how to document code, writing etiquette and testing. However, the fact that code is not written to a high standard should not prevent code sharing. The benefits of open code outweigh the potential unpleasantness experienced by the expert code writer.

Publications that make the used code available have, generally higher impact than publications where code is not available.
